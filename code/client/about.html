		 		<p>Volunteer Legal Services Hawaii is a non-profit legal service organization, established in 1981, that provides legal assistance to the community through education, legal advice clinics, brief services, and referrals to pro bono attorneys for direct representation.</p>
		 		<p>Volunteer Legal partners with volunteer attorneys to provide services to those who qualify based on income and legal issue.  Volunteer attorneys are the backbone of the organization, without whom access to justice could not be achieved in Hawaii.</p>
		 		<p>Volunteer Legal understands that not everyone can afford an attorney, but may be able to help themselves resolve legal issues if they are given the right information, professional support, and assistance.  Volunteer Legal staff and its volunteers assist with civil legal problems through services designed to help people handle legal problems on their own.</p>
